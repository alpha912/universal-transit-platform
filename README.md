# Universal Transit Platform

An open-source platform to unify global public transportation data and services.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to create a universal platform that standardizes public transportation data worldwide, making it easier for users to navigate and purchase tickets across different cities and countries. By integrating various transit systems into a single, user-friendly interface, we aim to simplify travel planning and enhance the public transportation experience globally.

## Features

- **Standardized Data Formats**: Unified data models for transit information.
- **Fare Calculation and Ticketing APIs**: APIs to calculate fares, recommend tickets/passes, and simulate purchases.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Support for multiple languages and regional settings.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Community-driven development encouraging global contributions.
